# cs290-exercise-tracker-portfolio

### About
This Exercise Tracker was designed and deployed as a Single Page Application that allows a user to track his or her completed exercises. This project showcases my ability to plan and implement a Full-Stack MERN App. The front-end UI for the app was created with React. It encompasses 3 pages  - a homepage, a page for creating exercise entries, and a page for editing exercise entries. The back-end functionality implements a RESTful API using NodeJS and Express. MongoDB supports data persistence. My work was created for the course CS 290 Web Development.

### Built With
This project was built with MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS and dotenv.
